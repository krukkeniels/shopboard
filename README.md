## Wikilink Formats

```

## Tips & Best Practices

### Organization
- Create separate folders for different item categories (Weapons, Potions, etc.)
- Use consistent naming conventions for items
- Tag items with rarity for better visual organization

### Pricing
- Set base prices in copper pieces for consistency
- Use shop modifiers for location-based pricing (expensive city vs. rural shop)
- Override specific item prices for special deals or rare items

### Performance
- The plugin caches up to 10,000 items for optimal performance
- Item cache is automatically refreshed when folders change
- Manual refresh available if needed

### Display
- Use the fantasy theme override for immersive gameplay
- Pop out the display to a second monitor for players
- Let auto-refresh handle changes - no need to manually update

## Troubleshooting

### Items Not Showing in Shop
- Ensure item notes have `type: item` in frontmatter
- Check that item folders are configured in settings
- Verify wikilinks match exact item names
- Run "Refresh item cache" command

### Shop Won't Display
- Confirm shop note has `type: shop` in frontmatter
- Check for YAML syntax errors in frontmatter
- Ensure all required fields are present

### Prices Showing as 0
- Verify items have `base_price` field
- Check that price is a number, not a string
- Ensure price modifier is a valid number

### Purchase Recording Fails
- Check that quantities are valid integers
- Ensure sufficient stock is available
- Verify shop note is not open in edit mode elsewhere
